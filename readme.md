## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor of this project.

## Timing

This exercise was mainly made on Friday 1th March 2019. I worked on this project from home. The exercise is a part of my educational training web development at BeCode.

## What is it?

This is a partly responsive 404 page with a dog in the spotlights. The focus for me was on making it look real and adding a little bit of animation.

## Struggles

It would have been nice if the animation was a little more logical. Now the dog goes offscreen and only shows up again after you move the mouse away from the dog area. So if you didn't see the dog was there before it goes away, you won't know it's there.
